            <h3><strong> BULLDOG: <span class="green">SPIKE:</span></strong></h3>
            <p class="want">They are a medium-size dog with a
                thick-set, low-slung body. Their short-muzzled head is massive and square. They have broad shoulders and
                chests, with thick, sturdy limbs. Although Bulldogs are low to the ground, they are wide and muscular.
            </p>
            <p class="want">Spike is sociable and sweet, but with a reputation for courage that makes him an excellent watchdog, the
                Bulldog is a lover, not a fighter. He's dignified rather than lively and has a kind although
                occasionally stubborn nature. The Bulldog is friendly and easygoing; he gets along with everyone.</p>

            <h3><strong> GERMAN SHEPHARD: <span class="green">WILLOW:</span></strong></h3>
            <p class="want">The German Shepherd Dog is
                one of America's most popular dog breeds â€” for good reasons. They're intelligent and capable working
                dogs.
                Despite their purebred status, you may find German Shepherds in shelters and breed specific rescues.</p>
