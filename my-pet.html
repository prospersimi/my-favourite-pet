    <p>The history of dogs is an old tale indeed.
        You could say as long as there has been civilisation, there have been records of humans and dogs. Dogs were
        domesticated
        from wolves around 15,000 years ago. New evidence suggests that dogs were first domesticated in East Asia,
        possibly
        China. Over time, the dog has developed into hundreds of breeds with a great degree of variation.</p>

    <p>Dogs, like humans, are highly social animals and this similarity in their overall behavioural pattern accounts
        for their trainability, playfulnes and ability to fit into human households and social situations. This
        similarity has earned dogs a unique position in the realm of interspecies relationships.</p>

    <p>The loyalty and devotion that dogs demonstrate as part of their natural instincts as pack animals closely mimics
        the human idea of love and friendship, leading many dog owners to view their pets as full-fledged family
        members.</p>

    <p>The common name for the domestic dog is ‘Canis familiaris‘, a species of the dog family ‘Canidae’. The dog is
        generally considered the ‘first’ domesticated animal.</p>

    <p>Dogs can differ in appearance, function, temperament and size. Some small dogs can weigh as little as 1.5 pounds,
        whereas some larger dogs can weigh as much as 200 pounds.</p>

    <p>Depending on the country, there are about 138 officially recognised dog breeds.</p>

    <p>Dogs fill a variety of roles in human society and are often trained as working dogs. For dogs that do not have
        traditional jobs, a wide range of dog sports provide the opportunity to exhibit their natural skills.</p>



    <p>It is estimated that for more than 12,000 years the dog has lived with humans as a hunting companion, protector
        and friend. A dog is one of the most popular pets in the world and has been referred to as ‘mans best friend’.
        Whether you are poor or rich, a dog will be faithful and loyal to you and love you to bits.</p>

    <p></p>A pet dog will fit easily into family life and environment, they of course need caring for as any other pet –
    feeding, grooming, bathing and when ill, will need a visit to the vets. Dogs thrive on affection and will happily
    wag its tail when showered with love and attention. Dogs will also sit and sulk if they get told off for doing
    something wrong.</p>

    <p>A well-mannered dog must be trained properly and with patience and perciverence. You must never mistreat a dog at
        any time as not only is it very wrong to mistreat any animal, but some will bite in their own defense.</p>

    <p>Larger dogs need considerably more exercise over a larger area than medium sized or small dogs. You can take them
        out into the countryside or to your local park or recreation ground. Here, they can run about and play games and
        get the exercise they need to keep them fit and healthy.</p>



    <p>Dogs can be taught how to do things. Throw a small branch, stick or frizzbee and you can teach your dog to go
        fetch and bring the item back to you. Dogs have nearly 220 million smell-sensitive cells over an area about the
        size of a pocket handkerchief (compared to 5 million over an area the size of a postage stamp for humans). Some
        breeds have been selectively bred for excellence in detecting scents.</p>

    <p>What information a dog actually detects when he is scenting is not perfectly understood. Although once a matter
        of debate, it now seems to be well established that dogs can distinguish two different types of scents when
        trailing an air scent from some person or thing that has recently passed by, as well as a ground scent that
        remains detectable for a much longer period.</p>
